### **TODO**
- functional Geodes, that spawn in-game
- working on crafting recipes for all items
- more uses throughout
- library functionality for all kinds of mods.

### DISCLAIMER
Currently, all items and blocks are only available through the creative menu. in the future, I will add possibilities to get them to Survival.
